  description: 'restores mana to characters.

    is a craftable item.

    potions
    are a product of crafting, to find them in the wild would be an extremely improbable
    outcome, unless the places you go are specifically and highly likely to have
    them. Like a town, although I wouldn''t recommend that option.'
